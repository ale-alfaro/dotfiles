GCC consists of a collection of front ends for various languages, which translate the source code into a language-independent form called <em>GENERIC</em>. This is then processed by a common middle end which provides optimization, and then passed to one of a collection of back ends which generate code for different computer architectures and operating systems. </p> <p>Functionally, this is implemented with a driver program (<code>gcc</code>) which provides the command-line interface for the compiler. It calls the relevant compiler front-end program (e.g., <code>f951</code> for Fortran) for each file in the source code, and then calls the assembler and linker as appropriate to produce the compiled output. In a copy of GCC which has been compiled with Fortran language support enabled, <code>gcc</code> will recognize files with <samp>.f</samp>, <samp>.for</samp>, <samp>.ftn</samp>, <samp>.f90</samp>, <samp>.f95</samp>, <samp>.f03</samp> and <samp>.f08</samp> extensions as Fortran source code, and compile it accordingly. A <code>gfortran</code> driver program is also provided, which is identical to <code>gcc</code> except that it automatically links the Fortran runtime libraries into the compiled program. </p> <p>Source files with <samp>.f</samp>, <samp>.for</samp>, <samp>.fpp</samp>, <samp>.ftn</samp>, <samp>.F</samp>, <samp>.FOR</samp>, <samp>.FPP</samp>, and <samp>.FTN</samp> extensions are treated as fixed form. Source files with <samp>.f90</samp>, <samp>.f95</samp>, <samp>.f03</samp>, <samp>.f08</samp>, <samp>.F90</samp>, <samp>.F95</samp>, <samp>.F03</samp> and <samp>.F08</samp> extensions are treated as free form. The capitalized versions of either form are run through preprocessing. Source files with the lower case <samp>.fpp</samp> extension are also run through preprocessing. </p> <p>This manual specifically documents the Fortran front end, which handles the programming languageâ€™s syntax and semantics. The aspects of GCC which relate to the optimization passes and the back-end code generation are documented in the GCC manual; see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/index.html#Top">Introduction</a> in Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The two manuals together provide a complete reference for the GNU Fortran compiler. </p>  <p class="header"> <p> Next: <a href="preprocessing-and-conditional-compilation#Preprocessing-and-conditional-compilation" accesskey="n" rel="next">Preprocessing and conditional compilation</a>, Previous: <a href="about-gnu-fortran#About-GNU-Fortran" accesskey="p" rel="prev">About GNU Fortran</a>, Up: <a href="introduction#Introduction" accesskey="u" rel="up">Introduction</a> [<a href="index#SEC_Contents" title="Table of contents" rel="contents">Contents</a>][<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-9.3.0/gfortran/Option-Index.html#Option-Index" title="Index" rel="index">Index</a>]</p> </p><div class="_attribution">
