Use this option to manually enable preprocessing of any kind of Fortran file. </p> <p>To disable preprocessing of files with any of the above listed extensions, use the negative form: <samp>-nocpp</samp>. </p> <p>The preprocessor is run in traditional mode. Any restrictions of the file-format, especially the limits on line length, apply for preprocessed output as well, so it might be advisable to use the <samp>-ffree-line-length-none</samp> or <samp>-ffixed-line-length-none</samp> options. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-dM</code></dt> <dd>   <p id="index-debugging_002c-preprocessor">Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <code>'#define'</code> directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the preprocessor, including predefined macros.

GCC will use this directory, when it is present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging information formats. This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated form <samp>-fno-working-directory</samp>.

For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a <code>'#'</code>. </p> <p>Warning: this currently handles C-Style comments only.

This is like <samp>-C</samp>, except that comments contained within macros are also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded. </p> <p>In addition to the side-effects of the <samp>-C</samp> option, the <samp>-CC</samp> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later use of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source line. The <samp>-CC</samp> option is generally used to support lint comments. </p> <p>Warning: this currently handles C- and C++-Style comments only.

In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline characters. </p> <p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program you may need to use the shellâ€™s quoting syntax to protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax. </p> <p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need to quote the option. With sh and csh, <code>-D'name(args...)=definition'</code> works. </p> <p><samp>-D</samp> and <samp>-U</samp> options are processed in the order they are given on the command line.
