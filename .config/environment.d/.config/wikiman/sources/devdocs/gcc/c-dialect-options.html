In C++ mode, it is equivalent to <samp>-std=c++98</samp>. </p> <p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code), such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the type of system you are using. It also enables the undesirable and rarely used ISO trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables recognition of C++ style ‘<samp>//</samp>’ comments as well as the <code>inline</code> keyword. </p> <p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite <samp>-ansi</samp>. You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included in compilations done with <samp>-ansi</samp>. Alternate predefined macros such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or without <samp>-ansi</samp>. </p> <p>The <samp>-ansi</samp> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be rejected gratuitously. For that, <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> is required in addition to <samp>-ansi</samp>. See <a href="warning-options#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>. </p> <p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <samp>-ansi</samp> option is used. Some header files may notice this macro and refrain from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the ISO standard doesn’t call for; this is to avoid interfering with any programs that might use these names for other things. </p> <p>Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in functions when <samp>-ansi</samp> is used. See <a href="other-builtins#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-std=</code></dt> <dd> <p id="index-std-1">Determine the language standard. See <a href="standards#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of these standard versions. This option is currently only supported when compiling C or C++. </p> <p>The compiler can accept several base standards, such as ‘<samp>c90</samp>’ or ‘<samp>c++98</samp>’, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as ‘<samp>gnu90</samp>’ or ‘<samp>gnu++98</samp>’. When a base standard is specified, the compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those using GNU extensions that do not contradict it. For example, <samp>-std=c90</samp> turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a <code>?:</code> expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when those features change the meaning of the base standard. As a result, some strict-conforming programs may be rejected. The particular standard is used by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> to identify which features are GNU extensions given that version of the standard. For example <samp>-std=gnu90 -Wpedantic</samp> warns about C++ style ‘<samp>//</samp>’ comments, while <samp>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</samp> does not. </p> <p>A value for this option must be provided; possible values are </p> <dl compact> <dt>‘<samp>c90</samp>’</dt> <dt>‘<samp>c89</samp>’</dt> <dt>‘<samp>iso9899:1990</samp>’</dt> <dd>

You may want to use the <samp>-fno-gnu-keywords</samp> flag instead, which has the same effect. In C99 mode (<samp>-std=c99</samp> or <samp>-std=gnu99</samp>), this switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since <code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99. </p> </dd> <dt><code>-fno-builtin</code></dt> <dt><code>-fno-builtin-<var>function</var></code></dt> <dd>   <p id="index-built-in-functions">Don’t recognize built-in functions that do not begin with ‘<samp>__builtin_</samp>’ as prefix.

The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking with a different library. In addition, when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function. For example, warnings are given with <samp>-Wformat</samp> for bad calls to <code>printf</code> when <code>printf</code> is built in and <code>strlen</code> is known not to modify global memory. </p> <p>With the <samp>-fno-builtin-<var>function</var></samp> option only the built-in function <var>function</var> is disabled. <var>function</var> must not begin with ‘<samp>__builtin_</samp>’.
