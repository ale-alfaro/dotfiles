<div class="sect1">  <p> Actions are always scoped to a particular object on which they operate. </p> <p> In GTK, actions are typically scoped to either an application or a window, but any widget can have actions associated with it. </p> <p> Actions scoped to windows should be the actions that specifically impact that window. These are actions like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fullscreen</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">close</span>”</span>, or in the case that a window contains a document, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">save</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">print</span>”</span>. </p> <p> Actions that impact the application as a whole rather than one specific window are scoped to the application. These are actions like <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">about</span>”</span> and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">preferences</span>”</span>. </p> <p> If a particular action is scoped to a window then it is scoped to a specific window. Another way of saying this: if your application has a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">fullscreen</span>”</span> action that applies to windows and it has three windows, then it will have three fullscreen actions: one for each window. </p> <p> Having a separate action per-window allows for each window to have a separate state for each instance of the action as well as being able to control the enabled state of the action on a per-window basis. </p> <p> Actions are added to their relevant scope (application, window or widget) either using the GActionMap interface, or by using <a href="gtkwidget#gtk-widget-insert-action-group"><code class="function">gtk_widget_insert_action_group()</code></a>. Actions that will be the same for all instances of a widget class can be added globally using <a href="gtkwidget#gtk-widget-class-install-action"><code class="function">gtk_widget_class_install_action()</code></a>. </p> </div><div class="_attribution">
