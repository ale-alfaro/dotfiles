                <div class="_page _gnu_make">  <h1 class="section">Recipe Echoing</h1>      <p>Normally <code>make</code> prints each line of the recipe before it is executed. We call this <em>echoing</em> because it gives the appearance that you are typing the lines yourself. </p> <p>When a line starts with ‘<samp>@</samp>’, the echoing of that line is suppressed. The ‘<samp>@</samp>’ is discarded before the line is passed to the shell. Typically you would use this for a command whose only effect is to print something, such as an <code>echo</code> command to indicate progress through the makefile: </p> <div class="example"> <pre class="example">@echo About to make distribution files
</pre>
</div>     <p>When <code>make</code> is given the flag ‘<samp>-n</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--just-print</samp>’ it only echoes most recipes, without executing them. See <a href="options-summary">Summary of Options</a>. In this case even the recipe lines starting with ‘<samp>@</samp>’ are printed. This flag is useful for finding out which recipes <code>make</code> thinks are necessary without actually doing them. </p>     <p>The ‘<samp>-s</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--silent</samp>’ flag to <code>make</code> prevents all echoing, as if all recipes started with ‘<samp>@</samp>’. A rule in the makefile for the special target <code>.SILENT</code> without prerequisites has the same effect (see <a href="special-targets">Special Built-in Target Names</a>). </p><div class="_attribution">
